# Cocos2d-x / Axmol Class Hierarchy

This project was created as a teaching aid for my students learning C++ and game development with Cocos2d-x/Axmol.

Interactive visualization of the Cocos2d-x and Axmol engine class hierarchy. Explore the inheritance tree, search for classes, and inspect their methods, properties, and relationships.
